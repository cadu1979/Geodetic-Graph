IDEA
tells wether or not a graph is geodetic
deploy online

ENTRY
entry method will be either through .txt file or the user will be able to use a graphic interface to build the graph

ALGORITHM
to calculate if a graph is geodetic the floyd-warshall algorithm is used

RETURN
"Graph is geodetic" or "Graph isn't geodetic"
if isn't -> image showing at least one of the pair of vertices that have more than one path
if is -> image either listing all shortest paths or showing them in color on the graph

PROBLEMS
how to deploy java
