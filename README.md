# Geodetic Graph

## Correct form of the graph's description

The description must contain only the IDs of the vertices, which are integers.
Each line in the description must start with the ID of a vertex and be followed by the IDs of that vertex's neighbors.
Each ID must be separated by a single space.

An example of the correct description for the graph pictured below:
